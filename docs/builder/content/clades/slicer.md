The `drum` is designed to easily slice and truncate audio. This clade is special in that it does note use note or chord syntax, but **it uses [hex](#hex) syntax** which defines the position of the slice (`0-f`). 

The slices can be moved around in the sample screen which can be accessed by pressing *tab*. In this screen you can select slices with *shift* + *left*/*right* and adjust them with *left* or *right*. You can zoom in with *up* or *down*. You can easily import samples. Samples are added simpy using the *ctrl* + *o* combination. Slices can be deleted with the `delete` key. See all the invocations in the [sample invocations](#sample-view).

The `drum` clade also features a additive synthesizer kick drum that can be integrated into the slices. The kick drum parameters are in `PARAMS > KICK`. This drum synth can be activated on any slice by going to a slice in the sample view mode and turning *E1* to change the volume of the kick to something > -48 dB.
